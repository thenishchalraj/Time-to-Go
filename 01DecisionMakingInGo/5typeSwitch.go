/*
The following rules apply to a switch statement âˆ’
    1. The expression used in a switch statement must have an variable of interface{} type.
    2. You can have any number of case statements within a switch. Each case is followed by the value to be compared to and a colon.
    3. The type for a case must be the same data type as the variable in the switch, and it must be a valid data type.
    4. When the variable being switched on is equal to a case, the statements following that case will execute. No break is needed in the case statement.
    5. A switch statement can have an optional default case, which must appear at the end of the switch. The default case can be used for performing a task when none of the cases is true. No break is needed in the default case.
