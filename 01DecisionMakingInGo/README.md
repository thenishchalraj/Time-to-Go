If you want to do some operation in certain case and rest of the opearation in other case then this type of situation is called decision making.  

Decision making structures require that the programmer specify one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.

Go programming language provides the following types of decision making statements :
1. If : An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.
2. If-else : An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the boolean expression is false.
3. nested if : You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).
4. switch : A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.
5. select : A select statement is similar to switch statement with difference that case statements refers to channel communications.
