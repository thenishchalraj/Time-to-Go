/*
The following rules apply to a select statement âˆ’
    1. You can have any number of case statements within a select. Each case is followed by the value to be compared to and a colon.
    2. The type for a case must be the a communication channel operation.
    3. When the channel operation occured the statements following that case will execute. No break is needed in the case statement.
    4. A select statement can have an optional default case, which must appear at the end of the select. The default case can be used for performing a task when none of the cases is true. No break is needed in the default case.
