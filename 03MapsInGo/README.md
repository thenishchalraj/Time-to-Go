## What is a map?  

Go provides another important data type named map which maps unique keys to values. A key is an object that you use to retrieve a value at a later date. Given a key and a value, you can store the value in a Map object. After the value is stored, you can retrieve it by using its key.  

A map is a builtin type in Go which associates a value to a key. The value can be retrieved using the corresponding key.  

## How to create a map?  

A map can be created by passing the type of key and value to the make function.  

*make(map[type of key]type of value)* is the syntax to create a map.
